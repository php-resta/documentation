# Resta Quick Start

If you want to have a quick start to resta.
Just take a look at this short document.
You will need to install it first, as with any framework or package.
We need a composer installer to install the resta api.
If you don't have a composer installer, please [composer](https://getcomposer.org/download)
Check out this link.

## How to install the resta?

```bash
$ composer create-project php-resta/skeleton company_name dev-master
```
> **company_name:** The directory to which you will install the resta api is generally a group name that is valid for your company name or projects.Thus, your api projects will be in this general directory.

Your resta skeleton structure is now ready.

```bash
$ cd company_name
```
You can pass to the home directory of your project using the terminal command.

## Create your first project.

Now it's time to create our project.Your project will be created in the src / app directory.Let's create a project named demo with the command below.

```bash
$ php api project create demo
```

If you get a response similar to the following, Oh! Excellent. You now have a new project called demo.

```bash
$  > Application called as "Demo" has been successfully created in the /path/company_name/src/app/Demo/
```
